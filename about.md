I’m an entrepreneur. I help companies build digital products, mostly consumer facing or B2B software and websites. That means I assist with product architecture, product development, project management, technical sourcing and strategic planning.

I’m a founding partner at [i-Logs SPRL, the affordable geeks company](http://i-logs.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy photography,  running and playing jazz trumpet. 
I'm a father  of two lovely girls and live in Brussels suburb.
