Welcome to this blog. My name is Grégoire Welraeds. I’m an entrepreneur. I help companies build digital products, mostly consumer facing or B2B software and websites. That means I assist with product architecture, product development, project management, technical sourcing and strategic planning.

I’m a founding partner at [i-Logs SPRL, the affordable geeks company](http://www.i-logs.com).

In my free time, I enjoy photography ([Follow me on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/137881132@N07)), running and playing jazz trumpet. I’m a father of two lovely girls and live in Brussels suburb. I am alos often hanging on Facebook and Hacker News. I no longer go to twitter and Google+ (I may blog about why I came from loving twitter to hate it).

My intent with this blog is to share my experience with online application development, entrepreneurship, start-ups and probably other points of interests (like dealing with two young ladies when your are a single father for instance). It will probably reflect what I am: a mix between tech, culture and business opiniated talks. I don't know how often (and how long to be honest) I'll publish new contents. Time will tell. Also, I'm not a native speaking english guy, so be tolerant if there are misspelled words here and there. I'll do my best to avoid that. 

To rule this blog, I'm using [github page](https://pages.github.com/), [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Vim editor](http://vim.org). The posts are written locally on my laptop in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and translated to static HTML by jekyll. When a post is ready to be published, I'm releasing them to github pages with [git](https://git-scm.com/). If you are interested to know more about my blogging process, go and have a look at [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

My very first post is about the current state of password management for online application. I'm working on it and hope to release it in the coming days.
